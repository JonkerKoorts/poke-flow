def categorize_pokemon_role(stats: dict) -> str:
    """
    Categorizes a Pokemon into a role based on its base stats using weighted calculations.
    
    Args:
        stats (dict): Dictionary containing the Pokemon's base stats
                     (hp, attack, defense, special-attack, special-defense, speed)
    
    Returns:
        str: The determined role ('Tank', 'Attacker', 'Speedster', or 'Support')
    
    Performance Notes:
        - Uses weighted multipliers instead of averages to reduce floating-point operations
        - Avoids redundant dictionary lookups by using .get() with default values
        - Employs single-pass calculation for each role to minimize iterations
